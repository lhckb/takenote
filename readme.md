# TakeNote

[Access the application by clicking here](https://takenote-lhckb.herokuapp.com/)

TakeNote is a note-taking web application developed by me using Django as backend, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It's my first "full stack" Django app, and i purposely kept the idea simple to ensure proper execution, so i can learn better as well.
It is hosted on Heroku, using the free version of PostgreSQL offered by the platform.

### In the app
In order to use the app you need to create an account, but you can also delete it whenever you like in the `Account` tab. All of your notes will be deleted too.
When creating or editing a note, the only required field is the title, you can leave the note field blank for whatever reason.
After creating a note, you can delete it(trash can icon), modify it(pencil icon or clicking anywhere in the note) or pin it(pin icon).
In the account tab you can change username or update your password.

#### Plans for the future
This being my first proper web app, i intend on adding more features, such as password recovery and adding images to your note. Feel free to suggest new features.
